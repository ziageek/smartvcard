            Social Media Warning (Divulgence of Personal & Private Information)
            Social media has provided a platform for internet users to disclose
            much personal information about themselves, in a way that seems
            innocuous, if not proper and expected. However, more than a few
            folks have already lived to regret personal information that was
            shared either by them or others. This has long been true of simple
            email. It is exponentially true of social websites and applications
            for social media on any other website, including this one. You are
            cautioned against carelessly disclosing information.
